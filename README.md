This is a repository that me, Brian, and my classmate, Kishaan, are working on for our final project for our programming patterns class. We are creating a restaurant stocking system with classes that interact with each other and accesses a database.

This program will include many actions to facilitate the management of the products in a restaurant. Actions such as adding, removing or altering the products, request shipment of new products from companies, the ability to track these requests and many more features, etc.
