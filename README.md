# Patterns-Project---Restaurant-Stock-System
This is a repository that my classmate, Kishaan, and I are working on for our final project for our programming patterns class. Our idea is to make a restaurant stocking system using Java and Database.

This program will include many actions to facilitate the management of the products in a restaurant. Actions such as adding, removing or altering the products, request shipment of new products from companies, the ability to track these requests and many more features.
